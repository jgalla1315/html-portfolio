<h1>The Best Movies According to Science</h1>
<h2>Uh oh, if you disagree with this list then you're a science denier</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Shrek</h3>
<p>The first Shrek movie, it introduces us to Shrek</p>

<h3>Shrek 2</h3>
<p>Double the fun.</p>

<h3>Shrek the Third</h3>
<p>This movie is mostly trash, but it has more Shrek than 
    all other movies not on this list, so it has to outrank them by law.<br />
    It's worth noting that I haven't seen Shrek Forever After.</p>
